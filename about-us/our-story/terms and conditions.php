            Zote Tours (smc-private) Company Limited's Terms & Conditions stipulate a 45% deposit for bookings, full payment 30 days prior to the trip, and cancellation fees for late cancellations. </p>



          <p> Travelers can amend itineraries with possible extra costs. Comprehensive travel and medical insurance is vital, as the company doesn't cover medical expenses. The itinerary may involve wildlife encounters; adherence to safety rules, passport, visa, baggage, and schedule details are highlighted, with limited refunds for unused services.

          </p>


          <p class="fr-text-narrow" style="text-align: center;">

            The company aids with flight bookings, but travelers must adhere to airline terms. It disclaims responsibility for delays or schedule changes and any resulting costs. Travelers are urged to review these terms for a safe and enjoyable trip.

                  Please be aware that these safaris may take you into close contact with wild animals. Attacks by wild animals are rare, but no safari into the African wilderness can guarantee that this will not occur. Neither Zote Tours (smc-private) Company Limited, nor their employees, can be held responsible for any injury or incident on the safari. Please note that most safari camps and lodges in Africa are not fenced. You are insisted to obey the local rules and the guide will always remind you even after his first briefing on this.

                  For safety and because space is restricted, baggage in some charter aircraft is restricted to a maximum of 20 kg per person in a soft bag. This includes camera equipment and carry-on baggage. Should guests arrive with excess baggage without prior warning their baggage could be delayed, as we may have to fly the baggage at a later stage at considerable extra cost to you. However, should the guests know in advance that the baggage will exceed the limit; we recommend you book an extra seat for the bags on the aircraft, at an additional cost to them.
